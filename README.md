# pokt-node-monitor
## Summary
Node Monitor is an open source tool for monitoring Pocket nodes and alerting node administrators when certain issues arise. 
The current version monitors the nodeâ€™s block height. If the block height is behind by more than a specified number, Node Monitor will send an email notification to one or more defined recipients. Future versions will also support monitoring other metrics such as disk, CPU, and memory usage. 

## Preliminary
To set up notification you'll need a <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">sendgrid</a> api key.

See documentation on how to set up an API key <a href="https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started">here</a>.

Log in into your node using ssh

```
ssh <hostname>
```
You can find the hostname by running 

```
hostname
```

You will need to log in as root to download and execute the script

Change to root user by

```
su 
```

Download and excecute the script from github
Use wget to download the script and set up the blockheight service
